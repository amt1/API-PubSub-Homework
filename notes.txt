The API I am using is the Public API for Public APIs, which is found here:
https://api.publicapis.org/entries

I chose this one because as soon as we were told to pick an API with an
authentication type other than OAUTH, it seemed an obvious choice of
data for filtering.

The API data is structured as in the following example:
The whole data set is a hash.
The first value is a count of the number of entries in the second value.
The second value is an Array of objects.
The objects each have keys as listed below.

Formatted JSON:
{
"count": 606,
"entries": [
{
"API": "Cat Facts",
"Description": "Daily cat facts",
"Auth": "",
"HTTPS": true,
"Cors": "unknown",
"Link": "https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/",
"Category": "Animals"
},
... (604 more of those)
{
"API": "Cats",
"Description": "Pictures of cats from Tumblr",
"Auth": "apiKey",
"HTTPS": true,
"Cors": "unknown",
"Link": "https://thecatapi.com/docs.html",
"Category": "Animals"
}

I would like to make this more generic. Here are my notes about that:
// Where is it specific to this API?
// The url in this file (app.js)
// The data structure and key names in the list_view.js file
// Could this be made more generic so that these specific details could be
// read in from somewhere else?
